const EXACT_TEXT = `This workspace has a locked rebuild spec. Before writing any code:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and everything in .claude/rules/ — these are
   non-negotiable, not suggestions.
2. Read spec/ in full. Every file there represents a decision that has
   already been made. Do not re-litigate any of it. If something in
   spec/ seems wrong or contradictory, STOP and ask.
3. Read spec/contracts/*.md. Match these interface shapes exactly. A
   correct implementation with the wrong shape still fails verification.

Then work in strict red-green-refactor cycles, not batch regeneration:

4. Pick ONE currently-failing test. Make the smallest possible change
   that could make it pass.
5. Immediately re-run the FULL tests/visible/ suite. If anything
   previously green is now red, revert and try a smaller fix.
6. Only once the full visible suite is green, move to the next test.
7. Never branch on a literal value that looks like a test fixture.

Do not touch tests/held-out/ until every visible test passes. Run it
once, at the end, as a final report.

If stuck on any test, say so explicitly rather than forcing a change
through. Report final pass/fail counts and anything you couldn't
satisfy without changing the spec.
