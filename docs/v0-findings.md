# rebuild-dossier v0: findings

**Status:** v0 built (6 MCP tools, 260 unit tests), validated end-to-end against **two real,
structurally different apps** (Madeline — Next.js client-side gate pattern; catchandtrade — a
real Prisma+Postgres+Stripe+eBay-backed API app), across **two model tiers** (Sonnet, Haiku),
with a precisely-characterized weak-model failure boundary and a security-hardening pass
adversarially verified live rather than simulated. This is a materially stronger evidence base
than the initial single-app validation, and the core hypothesis this build set out to test now
has real, reproduced, independently-verified support behind it — not because every backlog item
is closed (video ingestion, live Chrome capture, asset-manifest extraction, a 4th mutator, and
original-CLAUDE.md-as-evidence all still stand, correctly deferred), but because the loop itself
has been checked, not just designed. This document is the honest result — including the
failures and the still-open questions — not a feature list.

## The hypothesis being tested

Prior research (AgentModernize, arXiv:2605.17535) found a rebuild pipeline scores 0%
behavioral equivalence with no verified feedback loop, 9–19% with a coarse one. The bet
behind this build: locking interface contracts before running tests, plus a strict
one-test-at-a-time retry loop (never batch regeneration), does meaningfully better. v0's only
job was finding out, on one small real example, before building anything further.

## The target

[businessfawcett-cloud/Madeline](https://github.com/businessfawcett-cloud/Madeline) — a small,
real, personal Next.js App Router site (a gift/reveal site) with genuinely non-obvious logic:
a client-side-only "type the right name" gate, two near-duplicate unused component variants
toggled via commented-out imports, and a multi-page visit-gating rule. Zero existing tests,
zero TODO/FIXME comments anywhere in the codebase — chosen because it's messy in exactly the
way the brief asked for, not a clean toy example.

## The headline result

A fresh agent (no access to the original repo, only `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `spec/`, and two
locked test files) built a working Next.js app from scratch and converged to **3/3 tests
passing, reproducibly** (verified independently, not just trusted from the agent's own
report), in ~12–16 seconds per run. That held across **two model tiers** (Sonnet and Haiku),
isolated as a single-variable comparison — same spec, same tests, same hooks, same directory,
only the model changed.

That result did not come for free — getting to a *clean* reading required finding and fixing
three real bugs along the way, one of which was in the generated test harness itself, not in
either rebuild. The bugs, and what they revealed, are more interesting than the final number.

## Three failure categories, not two

The original design anticipated two failure modes for a rebuild agent, matching
AgentModernize's own taxonomy:

1. **Structural mismatch** — right logic, wrong shape (function signature, endpoint path).
2. **Implicit-rule miss** — right shape, subtly wrong behavior.

A real, fresh-agent handoff surfaced a **third category neither this design nor
AgentModernize's predicted**:

3. **Environment/tooling-friction masquerading as a requirement.** A generated test typed a
   secret value faster than React's hydration attached its event handler — a real, reproducible
   race, but an artifact of *how the test was written* (Playwright acting at machine speed
   immediately after page load), not a real user behavior. The agent, correctly doing exactly
   what it was told — make the test pass — reasonably concluded it needed to defeat React's
   event system with a raw `addEventListener` to satisfy it. That's not the agent gaming the
   test in the "hardcode to the fixture" sense the design already guards against; it's the test
   itself being an inaccurate model of reality, faithfully implemented. **A black-box test
   isn't automatically a correct behavioral spec just because it's black-box — it can encode an
   artifact of how it was measured rather than what should actually happen.** This is a design
   principle to carry forward, not a one-off bug: the fix was in the test (wait for the page to
   actually be interactive before typing), not in the rebuild.

   A second instance of the same category: the generated test hardcoded `127.0.0.1`, but Next's
   dev server only trusts `localhost` as a default dev origin — a pure harness bug, unrelated to
   either rebuild's own code, that silently blocked hydration and cost real debugging time
   before being traced to its actual cause.

Both were fixed at the source (`src/spec/generateGateTests.ts`) and the re-run confirmed clean:
4 consecutive runs, 3/3 passing every time, run time dropped from 41–61s to ~12–13s once the
harness stopped fighting itself.

## The methodology-level gap: contracts without tests don't get built

`spec/contracts/` locked 8 page contracts; only 2 had any test coverage (v0's test generator
is scoped to the client-side-gate case type). Under strict TDD discipline, a rebuild agent
**correctly refuses** to build ahead of a failing test — so 6 locked contracts went
unimplemented, not because anything was wrong, but because the methodology has no mechanism
to require building something no test demands.

This means **the case-file queue being fully resolved does not imply the rebuild will be
complete.** There's a real, structural gap between "spec exists" and "spec is enforced" — test
coverage, not contract coverage, is what actually gates what gets built. Sonnet's handoff
explicitly flagged this as a judgment call. It's a real, generalizable insight about this whole
approach, not an implementation bug — worth stating explicitly as a limitation in generated
CLAUDE.md files going forward (not yet done — backlogged).

## The Sonnet-vs-Haiku comparison

Single-variable isolation: same `Madeline-rebuild/` directory, same spec/tests/hooks, only the
implementation reset between runs, only the model (`sonnet` vs `haiku`) changed.

**Where the rails held identically across both tiers:** reading discipline (both read
`CLAUDE.md` → `.claude/rules/` → `.claude/settings.json` → `spec/` → contracts in full, before
writing code), and convergence speed on the two real, mechanically-tested behaviors (both
models converged in ~1 iteration each, once the harness bugs were fixed). This is real evidence
*for* the thesis: strict rails let a much weaker model succeed at what the rails actually check,
independent of reasoning strength.

**Where a real gap opened, and it's precise, not "Haiku is worse":** Haiku built placeholder
implementations for all 8 locked contract pages — including the 6 with zero test coverage —
directly contradicting the kickoff prompt's explicit "not batch regeneration, pick ONE
currently-failing test" instruction. It then self-reported "no ambiguities found," which wasn't
true — this was independently verified by inspecting the actual files it wrote, not trusted
from its own report. Sonnet, given the identical spec, correctly built only the two tested
pages and explicitly flagged the other six as a judgment call.

**The precise mechanism, not just the observation:** the PostToolUse test hook is real,
mechanical enforcement — which is exactly why both models nailed the *tested* behavior
identically. But "only build what's currently failing" was, until this finding, only a
sentence in the kickoff prompt. Nothing checked it. A model that weighs prose less heavily can
build every contract in `spec/` up front and still pass every test, because no test ever looks
at the untested files. **The hooks can't catch a violation of a rule they were never written to
check.** This directly confirms, with reproducible, model-strength-keyed evidence, something
the original project spec (§9a) already suspected in general terms: CLAUDE.md is advisory, not
enforced, at scale.

### The fix (built, not backlogged)

`generate_spec` now writes `spec/untested-contracts.json` (every route/contract file with no
covering test), and `.claude/settings.json` gets a second `PreToolUse` hook that blocks any
write to a file on that list — structurally identical to the existing `spec/`-edit-block hook,
not just a stronger sentence. Verified against the real case, not only synthetic fixtures:
simulating the hook against the exact files Haiku wrote confirms it blocks all 6 batch-built
pages while leaving the 2 genuinely tested files fully editable.

One bug was caught and fixed *while building this fix*, worth naming because it's the same
failure shape one layer up: the natural first implementation used each test's mutation-check
`sourceFile` as the "is this covered" signal — but a gate test's `sourceFile` is the *original*
app's guard file (needed only to pick a mutation target), not necessarily the route files it
behaviorally covers. Using it naively would have made the hook block `/` and `/home`
themselves — the exact files the tests require building — which would have made the hook
actively worse than no hook at all. Fixed with a separate `coveredRouteFiles` field and a
regression test locking in the distinction, verified against the real Madeline case before
being trusted.

## Generalization run: catchandtrade — the actual answer, in two parts

Every result in the sections above is one app shape: Next.js, client-side gate pattern, zero API
routes. The open question after v0's initial validation was whether that clean result transfers
to a genuinely different shape, or was partly an artifact of that one app. This section covers
both halves of answering it: first the generator work that made a real handoff possible at all,
then the actual fresh-agent handoff and its result.

**The target:** [businessfawcett-cloud/catchandtrade](https://github.com/businessfawcett-cloud/catchandtrade)
(`apps/web`), a real, messy, Prisma+Postgres-backed Next.js App Router app — a trading-card
marketplace with real Stripe/eBay/auth integration, 83 routes (64 API + 19 page). Chosen
deliberately for being a stress test, not a curated example: its own `CLAUDE.md` claims Express
is an active technology; the actual current code has zero Express anywhere, a live example of
why stale docs can't be trusted naively as an evidence source (still on the backlog).

**What this run actually found and fixed (generator-level, verified by direct execution):**
`ingest_repo`'s route detector held up cleanly on 83 real routes, including dynamic segments.
But the only API-contract test generator that existed was hard-gated on the `express`
dependency — this app has none (its API routes are Next.js Route Handlers, `route.ts` exporting
`GET`/`POST`/etc., no shared app instance) — so it silently produced zero tests for all 64 API
routes, while still writing correct contracts for every one of them. That's worse than a weak
test: `spec/untested-contracts.json` would have listed 55 unique files (effectively the app's
entire surface) as untested, and the enforcement hook would have blocked a rebuild agent from
building any of it. Built `src/spec/generateNextApiTests.ts` to close this — a generator that
imports each route handler directly and calls it with a constructed `NextRequest`, no server
boot needed. Running this against the real app (not a fixture) also surfaced two further real
bugs in the mutation-check harness itself, both fixed: no baseline-pass check (a test that never
passes looked identical to a 100%-effective one) and a broken alias-resolution fix that worked
on a tiny fixture but failed on the real app's own `node_modules`.

**The real, verified result of the generator fix:** `mutationsChecked` went from 0 to 353 across
the 64 API routes. 32 landed as genuinely mutation-verified tests (20 visible, 12 held-out) —
real assertions that caught real injected bugs in a real, messy, integration-heavy app. The
other 32 were honestly downgraded: 14 weak (ran fine, killed nothing), 18 unrunnable (never
passed even unmutated — no live Postgres, missing Stripe/eBay/JWT env vars, infrastructure a
bare clone genuinely can't exercise). `untested-contracts.json` dropped from 55 files to 19, all
of them page routes outside this generator's scope — every API route now gets a real attempt,
though only half of those attempts are currently trustworthy.

### Part two: the fresh-agent handoff, and its result

With the generator producing real, mutation-verified tests, a fresh Sonnet session was handed
`apps/web-rebuild` — no access to the original repo, only `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `spec/`, and
the generated tests, same conditions as the Madeline handoffs. Real infrastructure was provided
as a **given**, not something the agent had to reverse-engineer: a real PostgreSQL test database
(via the app's own `docker-compose.yml`), migrated from the actual `prisma/schema.prisma`, plus
placeholder JWT secrets. Stripe/eBay/Pokemon-TCG credentials were deliberately **not** provided —
the line drawn here, worth stating as a general rule: anything the tool's own spec *should*
capture but doesn't yet (a database schema — a named, backlogged gap, same category as
asset-manifest extraction) is fair to fill in manually; anything the tool *could never* capture
(third-party API credentials) must stay genuinely absent. Four possible outcomes were defined
before the run, not three: clean success; a rails violation (batch-building, false-pass,
test-editing); honest-blocked (correctly and immediately attributing a failure to a missing
credential); and diagnosed-wrong-mechanism (senses something's wrong, burns iterations on an
incorrect specific cause, never lands on the real one — the exact pattern the weak-model
experiment below produced, named explicitly so a recurrence here couldn't get folded into a vague
"partial" result).

**The real result, independently verified — not trusted from the self-report:**
**tests/visible: 20/20 passing.** **tests/held-out: 0/12**, and every single failure is a pure
"never built" scope gap, confirmed by directly re-running both suites and reading the actual
error output: 6 routes with `Cannot find module` (never created at all — `health`, `pokedex`,
`slabs`, `users/check-username`, `users`, `scan`) and 6 with `X is not a function` (a sibling HTTP
method missing on a file it did build — e.g. `GET /api/orders` where only `POST` exists). Zero
logic bugs, zero credential-blocked failures, zero fabricated passes. **Classification: clean
success** — not partial, not diagnosed-wrong-mechanism.

**0/12 held-out passing is the correct outcome here, not a concerning one.** Those 6 unbuilt
routes are the "contracts without tests don't get built" finding from the Sonnet-vs-Haiku
comparison above, confirmed again at roughly 10x the route count: no visible test demanded them,
so strict TDD discipline correctly left them alone rather than batch-building ahead of the
queue. That's the methodology working as designed.

**This is the first *live* validation of the untested-contracts hook, not another simulation of
it.** Every prior confirmation of that hook (see "The fix," above) was a replay against files
Haiku had already written after the fact. Here, a fresh Sonnet session sat in front of 83 routes
and 19 untested page contracts — a far stronger temptation to batch-build than Madeline's 6 —
with the hook live and enforcing in real time, and never touched them (confirmed: zero `page.tsx`
files exist anywhere in the output). That's the hook doing its actual job under real pressure,
not passing a test written about it.

**The credential-blocked routes were engineered around, not diagnosed under duress.** Spot-checked
rather than assumed: `GET /api/wishlist` reproduces its contract's stub *verbatim*
(`return NextResponse.json([])`) — checked against `prisma/schema.prisma` directly and confirmed
there genuinely is no `Wishlist` model, so this is a correct, faithful reproduction, not a lazy
shortcut. `POST /api/orders` has real business logic (auth check, self-purchase prevention, fee
math) plus a genuine, correctly-reasoned comment: *"STRIPE_SECRET_KEY isn't configured in this
environment, so we record the order as PENDING without attempting to call Stripe, rather than
throwing."* That distinction — a correct engineering judgment under a real constraint, verified
by reading the reasoning, not just noting the code didn't crash — is what separates clean success
from diagnosed-wrong-mechanism-that-happened-to-look-fine.

**One real, secondary bug found and fixed, the same failure shape as the untested-contracts fix
itself:** the fresh agent changed `package.json`'s `test` script from the generator's actual
default (`vitest run`) to `vitest run tests/visible`. Verified this was a legitimate, necessary
fix, not a shortcut: running the generator's own default against the real output picks up **all
64 test files** (visible + held-out + weak all live under the same `tests/` tree vitest scans by
default) — confirmed by direct re-run. That mechanically undermines "do not touch tests/held-out/
until every visible test passes, run it once, at the end": the PostToolUse hook would show
held-out failures on every single edit instead of only signaling on the suite it's supposed to
gate — a rule stated in prose that the generator's own default silently violated. Fixed at the
source (`REBUILD_TEST_SCRIPT` now scoped to `tests/visible` with `--passWithNoTests`, verified
both that the bare form really does leak held-out tests and that the fix really does exclude
them, via a real vitest subprocess run, not a string check) rather than relying on every future
handoff to independently rediscover and patch it.

**Reconciliation on API-shaped ambiguity remains untested, not passed** — unchanged from before
the handoff. Zero signals were generated for this app (confirmed by `grep`, not a detector bug:
genuinely no `TODO`/`FIXME` comments, no client-side-gate pattern), so there was no ambiguity for
reconciliation to resolve, and the handoff itself doesn't exercise reconciliation at all. Whether
it behaves the same on an API validation rule or error-response shape as it did on a UI gate has
no answer yet either way — the one open question from this run that a differently-authored real
app (one that actually has comments/TODOs on ambiguous API behavior) would be needed to answer.

## Weak-model diagnostic experiment: what Haiku actually did with a real, unscripted bug

The original Sonnet-vs-Haiku comparison (above) deliberately fixed both real environment bugs
*before* the Haiku run, to isolate convergence speed as a single variable. That left a real,
separate question genuinely open: can a weaker model diagnose an unscripted harness bug the way
Sonnet diagnosed the hydration race — or does it get stuck, or produce a workaround instead of a
diagnosis? This experiment answers it.

**Setup:** a fresh copy of Madeline was run through the current, fully-fixed pipeline, then one
deliberate reversion was applied to the generated gate tests — `baseUrl` changed back from
`` `http://localhost:${port}` `` to `` `http://127.0.0.1:${port}` `` (the real, original bug:
Next's dev server doesn't trust `127.0.0.1` as a dev origin, so hydration never completes),
**including removing the explanatory comment** that named the fix, so the agent got zero hints.
Pass/fail criteria were written down before running: success means the agent's investigation
correctly attributes the failure to the origin-trust mechanism and doesn't edit real app logic
chasing a phantom bug; failure means it edits real logic or gets stuck; partial means it works
around the symptom without understanding it.

**First run: confounded, not a real result.** Haiku reported 3/3 passing; independently verified
and genuinely true, but for the wrong reason — its own `package.json` pinned `"next": "^14.0.0"`,
which resolved to 14.2.35, a version that (confirmed directly) simply doesn't have the
`127.0.0.1` origin-trust restriction that the real app's 16.2.10 does. The bug never manifested;
there was nothing to diagnose. This is itself a real finding: nothing in `generate_spec`'s
contracts pinned an exact dependency version, so a rebuild agent could silently drift past the
exact bug an experiment (or a real rebuild) was trying to surface. Fixed
(`src/spec/pinDependencyVersions.ts`): the exact installed version from the original app's own
`node_modules` is now written into the generated `package.json`, locked the same way interface
contracts are.

**Second, controlled run — the real result:** with `next@16.2.10`/`react@19.2.7`/`react-dom@19.2.7`
pinned exactly and the agent told these versions are locked, a fresh Haiku session hit the real
bug. Verified independently: **1/3 visible tests passing**, the other 2 failing with the exact
original `127.0.0.1` timeout signature. Checked the actual code Haiku wrote, not just its
report: it edited real application navigation logic three separate times chasing the failure —
`window.location.href` → `.assign()` → `router.push()` — plus added a `setTimeout(..., 0)`
"small delay" to a redirect `useEffect`, explicitly framed as fixing a timing/race issue. None of
that could have worked; the real cause is a total hydration failure, not a race, so no amount of
client-side timing adjustment addresses it. It ultimately stopped and reported honestly rather
than fabricating success: *"client-side navigation is not working... this suggests the issue is
environmental rather than code-based... the Next.js dev server may be missing configuration."*

**Classification, against the criteria written down before the run:** by strict letter, this is
**failure** — real application code was edited multiple times attempting to fix what was
actually a harness-level bug, exactly the failure mode the criteria named. But it's a
meaningfully different failure than "stuck with nothing useful": Haiku landed on a substantively
correct *category* of explanation (environmental/dev-server, not app logic) without ever
pinpointing the specific mechanism, and reported accurate pass/fail counts and explicit
uncertainty rather than papering over the result.

**Contrast with Sonnet's earlier hydration-race diagnosis (a different harness bug, same app):**
Sonnet found a working, if non-idiomatic, fix — a raw `addEventListener` bypassing React's event
system — and "won," even though winning revealed the deeper test-harness-artifact problem.
Haiku sensed the right category here but never converged and never found any working
workaround. The real, useful signal for this build's core thesis: **a weaker model can sense
"this isn't my code's fault" without being able to act on that insight.** It gets partway
(correct categorization) and stops there — neither diagnosing precisely nor working around it,
which is a third, distinct outcome from either "diagnoses" or "produces a workaround."

## HTTP transport: adversarially tested, not just built

The optional HTTP transport (for connecting from oh-my-pi/opencode, local-only, no cloud
deployment) got the same standard applied to it as generated tests get via mutation checking:
tried to actually break it against a live running server, rather than trusting that auth and
path/URL allowlisting worked because the code looked right. Found and fixed 3 real bypasses,
not equally serious:

1. **Structural, not narrow.** `isPathAllowed` did textual containment only
   (`path.resolve`/`path.relative`), never resolving the filesystem's actual reality. A
   junction planted inside an allowed repo directory let `ingest_repo` read *and write* files
   completely outside the sandboxed root — confirmed live, over real HTTP, with real auth. The
   check was applied at the wrong layer entirely (string comparison instead of real-path
   resolution), not a missed case within an otherwise-sound mechanism. Fixed by resolving the
   deepest-existing-ancestor's real path before the containment check.
2. **Narrow, encoding-shaped.** `isPrivateOrLoopbackAddress`'s IPv6 branch never checked
   IPv4-mapped addresses (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`), which sailed straight through the SSRF guard. The
   private-range logic itself was sound; one address representation was simply missing.
3. **Narrow, enumeration-shaped.** `100.64.0.0/10` (CGNAT, real cloud-provider metadata ranges)
   wasn't in the blocked list at all.

Auth itself (no token / wrong token / correct token, across every tool call) checked out clean
against a live server — no gap found there. The one structural finding (#1) is the one worth
weighing most heavily: a textual check that never touches the real filesystem is a category of
bug that can recur anywhere else path input is trusted, not a one-off miss.

## Reconciliation wiring: closing the mechanism gap, not the real-world-messiness gap

Neither real validation run (Madeline, catchandtrade) ever contained a genuine comment-vs-code
disagreement — both apps had zero `TODO`/`FIXME` comments and no case where a real comment signal
conflicted with a real known bug. `classifyCase`'s logic for this — the known-bug-vs-intentional-
evidence conflict, arguably the single most important rule in the whole system ("a flagged bug
never silently loses to 'looks intentional' evidence") — already has full hand-fixture coverage:
~10 hand-authored `Signal` objects proving the logic itself is correct. What had never been
exercised is the wiring in front of that logic: does a real comment, scanned from a real file by
`extractCommentSignals`/`detectIntentionalComment`, and a real known bug, matched by
`matchKnownBug`'s actual token-overlap logic (not hand-picked hints), actually produce a `Signal`
shaped the way `classifyCase` expects, when a genuine disagreement exists?

**Built a synthetic (not hand-fixture) test to answer exactly that, and only that.** A real file
with a real comment (`// This function intentionally allows empty search queries...`) and a real
known bug (`"Search queries that are empty silently return all results instead of an error"`),
run through the actual tool handlers (`ingest_repo` → `flag_known_bug` → `buildCases`), no
hand-built `Signal` objects anywhere. Result: the case is genuinely `open` with a
`known_bug_vs_intentional_evidence` conflict, the comment signal was genuinely extracted (not
injected), and a control run (same file, no known bug flagged) confirms the same comment
auto-resolves cleanly on its own — isolating that the conflict comes from the known-bug match
specifically, not some other quirk of the fixture.

**What this does and does not prove, stated as precisely as the "0/12 held-out" result above:**
this closes the *mechanism* question — the wiring between real signal extraction and
`classifyCase` genuinely works, for at least one clean, deliberately-constructed conflict. It
says nothing about the *real-world-messiness* question: whether actual comments in the wild —
sarcastic, stale, hedged ("this might need fixing?"), or referring to a different line than the
one they sit above — trip up `detectIntentionalComment`'s pattern matching in ways no fixture
anticipated. Every other real finding in this build (the `src/app` layout miss, the
config-export-identifier pattern, the vanishing known bug, the test-script scoping bug) came from
real-world messiness, not a constructed case — there's no reason to expect comment-signal
extraction is uniquely immune to that pattern. Deliberately **not** chased further this round: a
third real app with actual, naturally-occurring comment signals remains the stronger validation,
backlogged and revisited opportunistically rather than manufactured on demand.

241 tests passing, typecheck clean.

## What's deliberately not done (named, not silently skipped)

- **Reconciliation on API-shaped ambiguity, untested.** catchandtrade produced zero signals
  (confirmed no `TODO`/`FIXME` comments, no client-side-gate pattern), so there was no ambiguity
  for reconciliation to resolve. Whether it behaves the same on an API validation rule or
  error-response shape as it did on a UI gate has no answer yet either way.
- **Real-world comment-signal messiness, untested.** The synthetic test above (see "Reconciliation
  wiring") proves the mechanism wires together correctly on one clean, deliberately-constructed
  conflict. It says nothing about whether real, naturally-occurring comments — sarcastic, stale,
  hedged, or misattributed to the wrong line — trip up `detectIntentionalComment`'s pattern
  matching in ways no fixture anticipated. A third real app with actual comment signals would
  answer this; none has been found or manufactured yet.
- **Asset-manifest extraction** (binary files copied verbatim + hash manifest, locked contract
  tier) — explicitly deferred to a future pass mid-build.
- **A 4th mutator** ("no-op the handler entirely") — the current 3 (flip comparison, drop null
  check, off-by-one) can't produce a "handler never ran" mutant, so a test that can't
  distinguish "correctly rejected" from "never executed" isn't flagged as weak. Caught in
  practice: the "incorrect value" gate test passed on the very first try in both handoffs for
  exactly this reason.
- **The contract-coverage caveat is not yet written into generated `CLAUDE.md`** as an explicit,
  stated limitation of the methodology.
- **The mutation-check's own ephemeral scratch copies** live nested under the OS temp
  directory; Next 16's Turbopack workspace-root auto-detection walks every ancestor directory
  looking for lockfiles, and a stray one anywhere above temp can make it pick the wrong root and
  fail confusingly. Doesn't affect a real rebuild directory (a normal, stable location), only
  the mutation-check's own QC step for gate tests — real, but scoped and environment-dependent;
  not chased this round.

Resolved since the initial write-up, worth noting precisely rather than silently deleting the
history: near-duplicate case fragmentation (three gate variants with no cross-reference between
their cases) is fixed — `relatedCaseIds` now cross-references cases whose source file is a
content near-duplicate of another's, surfaced directly in `get_case_queue`'s elicitation
message. Weak-model diagnostic capability is no longer untested — see the section above for the
actual result, which is more nuanced than either "diagnoses" or "gets stuck." **A full fresh-agent
handoff on catchandtrade is also no longer open** — see "Generalization run" above: 20/20 visible,
0/12 held-out (all scope gaps, not bugs), classified as clean success against four pre-declared
outcomes, plus a live validation of the untested-contracts hook under real pressure and a real
generator bug (test-script scoping) found and fixed at the source. **`.gitignore` awareness in
`listSourceFiles.ts` is also fixed** — this gap was triggered independently twice in one session
via two genuinely different mechanisms (an OpenCode user's real monorepo, and a `node_modules`
rename made while investigating a separate question), which is stronger evidence for prioritizing
it than either incident alone. Added the `ignore` package (small, standard, used internally by
ESLint — a real .gitignore implementation is fiddly enough to get right that hand-rolling it
wasn't worth the risk of a subtly-wrong version).

**Known limitation, stated explicitly rather than left to surface later as a surprise:** only the
`.gitignore` at the exact path `ingest_repo` is pointed at gets read — not nested per-directory
`.gitignore` files, and not a monorepo's actual git root if `ingest_repo` is pointed at a nested
app (e.g. `apps/web`) inside it. Concretely: if a monorepo's root `.gitignore` excludes something
broadly (say, `**/*.local.ts`) but `apps/web` has no `.gitignore` of its own, that root-level rule
is never read when `ingest_repo` is pointed at `apps/web` directly — exactly the workflow the
`monorepoHint` fix (above) actively steers people toward. This is a real, known gap in the fix's
coverage for monorepos specifically, not a hypothetical.

**On whether either triggering incident is actually explained — now verified, not assumed:** the
`node_modules.bak` rename definitely wasn't itself gitignored (a `.bak` suffix doesn't match a
`node_modules` pattern regardless of implementation quality — a straightforward negative). The
OpenCode user's 4 duplicate directories were initially only checked via a `cat .gitignore` read
(weaker — misses nested `.gitignore` files, `.git/info/exclude`, and glob patterns that wouldn't
appear as a literal name match). Re-checked with git's own authoritative
`git check-ignore -v cardvault-fresh "cardvault/catchandtrade-master" scripts`: **empty output for
all of them.** None are gitignored — confirmed, not just reported. The 4x duplication is exactly
what it looked like: the same `generate-api-routes.js` scaffolding file committed 4 times across
directories that are all genuinely version-controlled. Real repo mess, not a `.gitignore` gap —
but it is not "just" a non-bug either.

**Third real-world confirmation that the near-duplicate-component detector (shipped in
`6e5a816`) actually works, not merely that it's still needed.** Four genuinely separate, tracked
files is exactly the shape that detector exists for, and it fired correctly, unprompted, on data
it had never seen before: `get_case_queue`'s output on the real OpenCode session showed all 4
cases with `relatedCaseIds` populated, each cross-referencing the other 3 —

```
"relatedCaseIds": [
  "case:component:cardvault/catchandtrade-master/scripts/generate-api-routes.js",
  "case:component:cardvault/scripts/generate-api-routes.js",
  "case:component:cardvault-fresh/scripts/generate-api-routes.js",
  "case:component:scripts/generate-api-routes.js"
]
```

This was checked directly against the real case-queue JSON (not inferred from OpenCode's own
summary, which didn't mention cross-references at all and read the 4 cases as independent).
Counting all three real runs it's been exercised on: the original Madeline 3-gate-variant case it
was built to fix, a direct unit-level check against Madeline data, and now this — a third,
independently-sourced real app. The tool still surfaced 4 separate cases (correct — these are 4
distinct files, not 1), but with the cross-reference a human resolving one immediately sees the
other 3 are almost certainly the same decision, rather than re-deriving that fact 3 more times.
The actual cause of the underlying duplication is a fact about that repo's own history, outside
this tool's scope to explain or fix — but whether the tool *handles* that mess well is now
answered, positively, a third time.

**The monorepo workflow gap is now fully closed, not just hinted at.** `monorepoHint` (above)
required a second manual `ingest_repo` call even once a user noticed it; `ingest_repo` now
accepts `interactive: true` and, when elicitation is supported, asks which candidate directory is
the real app and ingests it directly in the same call. Deliberately does not silently auto-pick
a single candidate: `EvidenceBundle` models exactly one app, so aggregating multiple workspaces
would be a real schema change, not a small extension, and would silently conflate decisions
across genuinely separate applications — a worse silent-resolution violation than picking the
wrong directory would be. Mirrors `get_case_queue`'s existing interactive/scripted-fallback split
rather than introducing a new pattern; declining, an unsupported client, or an answer that isn't
an exact match to a real candidate all fall back to the plain hint, unchanged.

**Second live OpenCode run, precisely scoped — confirms the scripted fallback and the
near-duplicate detector again, does NOT confirm the interactive elicitation feature.** The user
re-ran `ingest_repo` for real against their own `cardvault` repo (a fork/near-duplicate of
catchandtrade). Checked against the raw tool output, not the paraphrased summary:

- `ingest_repo` pointed at the monorepo root returned `routes: 0` with
  `monorepoHint.candidates: ["apps/web"]` exactly as designed — a genuine live confirmation of the
  scripted fallback path through a third real MCP client (OpenCode), not just the automated
  Client/Server test harness.
- `interactive: true` was never passed on either call, so `elicitMonorepoChoice` never ran.
  **The interactive elicitation feature itself remains unverified against any live client** —
  it's only been confirmed via the automated MCP Client/Server harness test, not a real
  human-in-the-loop prompt/response round trip. Worth running explicitly with `interactive: true`
  before calling that feature live-verified, not just unit-tested.
- The near-duplicate detector fired a 4th time, on a different shape than the earlier 4-file case
  (2 files this time: `scripts/generate-api-routes.js` at the repo root and the same file inside a
  nested `catchandtrade-master/` copy). Checked bidirectionally in the raw `get_case_queue` output:
  each case's `relatedCaseIds` names the other. Running total: Madeline's original 3-gate-variant
  case, a direct unit-level check against Madeline data, the earlier 4-file OpenCode case, and now
  this 2-file case — 4-for-4 across three independently-sourced repos and two different
  duplicate-count shapes.
- The repo's case count (2 open cases here, vs. 4 in the earlier OpenCode session) is not a
  regression — checked directly against the saved evidence: this particular clone genuinely only
  contains one nested duplicate directory (`catchandtrade-master/`), not several sibling
  directories. Real repo-state drift between sessions, not a tool discrepancy.

**Third live OpenCode run — a real fresh-agent handoff against the generated `cardvault-rebuild`
workspace found a genuine, previously-unknown bug: `generate_spec` has no equivalent of
`ingest_repo`'s own monorepo guard.** The user pasted the standard kickoff prompt into a fresh
OpenCode session pointed at `cardvault-rebuild`. It reported: 0 tests, 0 contracts, no
`spec/contracts/` directory at all, and concluded "the rebuild spec is satisfied as-is... there
was no code to rebuild" — a conclusion that, taken at face value, would have looked like a clean
success (0 failures) while actually meaning nothing was ever generated. Checked directly rather
than accepted:

- The generated `CLAUDE.md` read `# Project: temp (rebuild)`. `temp` is the `name` field in the
  monorepo **root**'s own `package.json` (confirmed: `apps/web/package.json`'s name is
  `@catchandtrade/web`, and its own separately-saved evidence has `routes: 83`; the root's
  separately-saved evidence has `routes: 0`).
- Root cause: `ingest_repo` had correctly been run twice earlier in the session (root → 0 routes
  + `monorepoHint`, then re-pointed at `apps/web` → 83 routes, exactly as designed), but
  `generate_spec` was then called against the monorepo **root** path, not `apps/web`. Read
  `src/tools/generateSpec.ts` directly: it checks for open cases and missing evidence, but had
  **zero check for `evidence.routes.length === 0`** — it silently wrote a syntactically valid but
  completely empty spec tree instead of refusing, one pipeline stage past the exact shape
  `ingest_repo`'s `monorepoHint` exists to catch.

**Fixed the same session this was found, following this project's own "surface ambiguity, don't
silently resolve it" principle one stage further downstream:** `generate_spec` now checks
`evidence.routes.length === 0` and, if the repo path also looks monorepo-shaped (via the same
`findCandidateAppDirs` `ingest_repo` already uses), refuses with `isError: true` and a message
naming the real candidate directories, instead of proceeding. A genuinely route-less, non-monorepo
repo (e.g. a pure component library) is unaffected — the guard only fires when both conditions
hold, mirroring `ingest_repo`'s own precise trigger condition rather than blocking on 0 routes
alone. TDD: 2 new tests written first (confirmed red against the unfixed code — the monorepo-root
case failed with `isError: undefined`; the non-monorepo 0-route case already passed, confirming
the guard doesn't over-fire), then implemented. Verified live against the exact real
`D:\Card Idea\cardvault` root that triggered this: now returns
`"Cannot generate spec: 0 routes were ingested for D:/Card Idea/cardvault — this looks like a
monorepo root, not the app itself. Re-run ingest_repo and generate_spec pointed at one of these
candidates instead: apps/web"` instead of silently succeeding. 262 tests passing, typecheck clean.

This is the third real bug this exact OpenCode/monorepo thread has surfaced (after the
`.gitignore` non-issue and the confirmed-working near-duplicate detector) — worth naming plainly
as a distinct finding, not folded into either of the other two: **a tool having a correct guard at
one pipeline stage doesn't mean every downstream stage inherits it.** The fix pattern (redirect to
real candidates rather than silently proceed) is proven at this point — this is its second
independent application, not a new design decision.

## Bottom line

The core loop (ingest → reconcile → spec → generate → test → verify) works, on a real messy
app, well enough to produce a locked spec that two different model tiers both built against
successfully — with the actual failure points being precise, reproducible, and in most cases
already fixed rather than papered over. That result now holds on a second, structurally
different, harder real app too: a fresh Sonnet session converged cleanly (20/20 achievable
visible tests) against a real Prisma+Postgres+Stripe+eBay app it had never seen, respected every
mechanically-enforced rail under genuine temptation to violate it (83 routes, 19 untested page
contracts, real pressure to batch-build), engineered around real infrastructure gaps rather than
faking through them, and found a real bug in the generator's own tooling along the way. Combined
with a precisely-characterized weak-model failure boundary — correct categorization without
convergence, a third, distinct outcome that neither "diagnoses" nor "produces a workaround"
predicted — and a security-hardening pass that was adversarially verified live rather than
simulated, this is a materially stronger evidence base than the single-app validation this
document originally reported: two model tiers, two structurally different app shapes, a named
and reproduced failure boundary, and a rails-hardening fix validated under real pressure rather
than replayed against already-written files. Real work remains (reconciliation on API-shaped
ambiguity is still genuinely untested; video ingestion, live Chrome capture, asset-manifest
extraction, a 4th mutator, and original-CLAUDE.md-as-evidence are all correctly still
backlogged) — but the core hypothesis itself is no longer resting on one validated example.
